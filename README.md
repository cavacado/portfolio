#portfolio repo

This will be the holding repo of my digital portfolio website

For my portfolio, I decided to adopt a simple approach, just a simple static file with hrefs to my github projects

Although a little plain, I feel that this provides a snapshot into my personality, that I prefer simple functioning applications to more complex ones.
